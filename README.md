# tech_test_saucelabs
Tech test for Dell

Project is a maven project so maven env variable should be set
Project is a JAVA project so java env variable should be set

POM should downlaod everythign to run the tests

Ive provided annotation to allow seperate sections to be ran idividually

I tried to cover some test cases in each section to give a broad coverage of the whole site. Due to time constraints I ahd to cover the main ones I thought would have the most impact
and highlight the different issues associated with the different users.
